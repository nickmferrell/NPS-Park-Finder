<!-- Requirements:
The user must be able to search for parks in one or more states.
The user must be able to set the max number of results, with a default of 10.
The search must trigger a call to NPS's API.
The parks in the given state must be displayed on the page. Include at least:
Full name
Description
Website URL
The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
As a stretch goal, try adding the park's address to the results.

This exercise should take about an hour to complete. If you're having trouble, attend a Q&A session or reach out on Slack for help. -->
